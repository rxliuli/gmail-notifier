# Privacy Policy

## Your Privacy is Our Priority

This extension is designed with privacy-first principles. **We don't collect, store, or process any of your email data.**

## How It Works

- All email operations happen directly between your browser and Gmail
- Email content never passes through our servers
- No analytics or tracking implemented
- Settings stored locally in your browser only

## Data Protection Mechanisms

### Technical Safeguards

- **End-to-End Security**: All communications with Gmail use HTTPS encryption
- **No Data Storage**: We do not store any email content on our servers
- **Local Processing Only**: All email data processing happens within your browser's secure environment
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: We never see or store your Google account password
- **Minimal Permissions**: We only request the minimum Gmail API permissions necessary for functionality

### Security Practices

- **No Data Collection**: We cannot protect what we don't collect - email data never touches our infrastructure
- **Secure Authentication**: OAuth tokens are stored securely in your browser using Chrome's storage APIs
- **Automatic Token Expiry**: Authentication tokens expire automatically and must be renewed
- **No Third-Party Access**: Your email data is never shared with or accessible to third parties
- **Regular Security Updates**: The extension is actively maintained with security patches

## Gmail API Usage

We use Gmail API solely to:

- Fetch and display new email notifications
- Show unread count
- Enable email actions (read, archive, delete, reply)

All API calls go directly from your browser to Gmail's secure servers.

## Required Permissions

- **Gmail API access**: Core email functionality
- **Browser notifications**: Desktop alerts
- **Storage**: Local settings only
- **gmail.com access**: Required for Gmail integration

## Data Retention

- **OAuth Tokens**: Stored locally in your browser and can be revoked at any time
- **User Preferences**: Stored locally and deleted when extension is uninstalled
- **No Server-Side Data**: We maintain no databases of user information

## User Rights & Control

- **Access**: All your data remains in your Gmail account under your control
- **Deletion**: Uninstalling the extension removes all local data
- **Revocation**: You can revoke Gmail access anytime via [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- **Portability**: Your emails remain in Gmail, fully portable

## Open Source Transparency

This extension is 100% open source, including our backend. You can:

- Review all code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rxliuli/gmail-notifier)
- Verify our privacy claims yourself
- Self-host if preferred

## Third-Party Services

- **Payments**: Processed by secure payment providers (Paddle)
- **Gmail**: Subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## Incident Response

In the unlikely event of a security incident:

- Users will be notified immediately via email
- Detailed disclosure will be posted on our GitHub repository
- Remediation steps will be provided
